# CVE Operator

## Overview
The CVE Operator is a Kubernetes operator designed to monitor GitHub repositories for new releases containing CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) updates. It fetches releases from specified GitHub repositories, checks for assets tagged with CVE updates, and manages custom resources representing these updates in a Kubernetes cluster. This automation aids in the continuous monitoring and management of security updates, crucial for maintaining the security posture of applications that rely on these dependencies.

## Features
- **Automated Monitoring**: Automatically monitors CVE GitHub repository for new releases.
- **CVE Updates Detection**: Detects assets within releases that contain CVE updates.
- **Resource Management**: Manages custom resources in Kubernetes that represent the detected CVE updates.
- **Configurable**: Users can configure which GitHub repositories to monitor through custom Kubernetes resources.

## Prerequisites
To use the CVE Operator, you will need:
- A Kubernetes cluster (version 1.18 or later recommended).
- Kubectl configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster (version v1.11.3+.)
- Access to a container registry where the operator's image will be stored (docker version 17.03+.)
- go version v1.22.0+

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cve-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cve-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/cve-operator:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/cve-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
